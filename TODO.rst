TODO

    - Find a better way to add more type support without endlessly chaining elifs.
    - Maybe find a way to rewrite formencode's crazy api.
    - Start writing tests to handle all the weird cases.
    - Support Annotated metadata passing arguments directly to the underlying schemas/validators.
